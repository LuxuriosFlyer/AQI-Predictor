# AQI-Predictor

Measuring Air Quality Index (AQI) accurately is an important step for safeguarding both human civilization and the environment. Traditional AQI measurement techniques depend on extensive infrastructure, advanced monitoring equipment, and substantial financial and human resources, making it difficult to implement these
systems in developing and remote regions. There is a clear need for more accessible and cost-effective alternatives.

This project introduces a machine learning-based model that enables individuals to estimate AQI using their mobile devices without needing internet access or complex equipment. By harnessing the computational capabilities of smartphones, this approach provides a user-friendly and convenient method for real-time AQI
estimation. Making air quality data readily available through everyday technology empowers users to make informed environmental decisions. The proposed model not only streamlines the process of obtaining AQI data but also seeks to increase public awareness about air pollution. When assessing air quality becomes as easy as using a mobile app, it encourages more people to engage with environmental issues. This greater accessibility can lead to proactive behaviors aimed at health protection and advocacy for cleaner air, fostering a more informed and environmentally conscious society.
